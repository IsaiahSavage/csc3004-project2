Request Pipe Format: "REQUEST BOOK:CHAPTER:VERSE"
	FIELD TYPES
		- REQUEST is a function request ('lookup', 'next', or 'prev')
		- BOOK, CHAPTER, and VERSE are integers
	REASONING
		- Requesting a method instead of the number of verses allows each
		verse to be passed individually. This allows the logic for displaying each verse with its 
		respective reference, as well as the logic for determining changes in book and chapter, to
		happen much more naturally.
		- A Ref object can be constructed from a string formatted as BOOK:CHAPTER:VERSE.
Reply Pipe Format: "STATUS BOOK:CHAPTER:VERSE TEXT"
	FIELD TYPES
		- STATUS is an integer representation of LookupResult enum
		- BOOK, CHAPTER, and VERSE are integers
		- TEXT is a string representing the text of the requested verse (returned only when request 
		was for 'lookup' method)
	REASONING
		- Passing status first allows for easy checking of success/failure. If a failure occurs, the
		rest of the input does not need to be read, thereby allowing for potentially faster 
		feedback.
		- A Ref object can be constructed from a string formatted as BOOK:CHAPTER:VERSE.
		- A Verse object can be constructed form a string formatted as BOOK:CHAPTER:VERSE TEXT.
